Amazon API Gateway acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from backend services, such as AWS Lambda, EC2, or any web application.

API - Application Programming Interface

Users interact with AWS API Gateway by sending HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to API endpoints defined in the service
User ---> API Gateway ---> EC2/Lambda

API Gateway acts as a centralized “front door” that receives these requests, applies access controls, routing, and authentication, then forwards the requests to backend AWS resources 
or services, such as EC2, Lambda, or databases.
